#Starter Equation
Batters Faced = 7.5006(innings pitched)^0.6732 #if batters faced exceeds number for given inning, pull
if ((9-inning) > runners on  and runners+1 > lead and outs < 2) and inning < 8:
	pull
elif inning == 8 or 9 and no nono and lead =< 3 and 1 runner:
	pull
elif inning == 8 or 9 and run scores:
	pull

	


#When to sub relief pitcher
If non-closer faces 5 in one inning:
	pull
If lead > 4 or inning is < 6:
	non-closer pitches until two men on
If lead is < 4 in inning 9:
	bring in closer
If closer gives up tying run, but not-go ahead:
	pull
If closer goes down by 3 or the go up by 4 run is at the plate:
	pull
