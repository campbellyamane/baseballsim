This code simulates outcomes of today's baseball games based on 2017-18 statistics for today's lineups.

# Instructions
This program is written for Python 2.7. In order to generate today's predictions, download all files and run "python game.py" in the directory's command line. Select your game and watch the algorithm chug! If 5,000 sims is too many, you can change that number in line 115 of the game.py file.
